Many of last year's spring high school graduates did not secure a place at university, according to figures from Statistics Finland.

More than 65 percent of new graduates did not enter university, marking an increase of one percentage point for women and two percentage points for men compared to 2022.

The majority of high school graduates — nearly 80 percent — applied for further studies, but only about 35 percent were able to move on to tertiary education. Of this group, 21 percent got into university, 12 percent were admitted to universities of applied sciences while 1.5 percent went into vocational education.

Since the peak years of the early 2000s, the educational level of young people in Finland has fallen from the top echelon to mid-table among industrialised countries.
